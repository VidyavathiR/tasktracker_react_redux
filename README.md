# Task Tracker

Welcome to Task Tracker, a project aimed at mastering modern web development techniques using React, Redux, JSON Server, and Thunk middleware.

## Overview

Task Tracker is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It leverages React for building a dynamic and responsive user interface, Redux for state management to ensure data consistency across components, and Thunk middleware for handling asynchronous operations seamlessly. JSON Server is used as a mock backend to simulate server interactions, making development and testing smoother.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, delete, and update tasks with ease.
- **State Management**: Utilizes Redux for centralized state management.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Thunk middleware manages async logic, ensuring smooth task updates.
- **Mock Backend**: JSON Server provides a simulated backend environment for testing.
